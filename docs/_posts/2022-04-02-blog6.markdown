This week i focused my attention on the 2 EC2 instances required for the group project. As i have have not had that much experience i was struggling to figure out how to start it all togeher. I knew i needed to start with some kind of layout or structure. I have also needed to look into terraform and understand how it plays a role in communicating with AWS to host our site.
