After a few group meetings and one in person metting, we have defintely shifted gears in terms of our productivity on this project. Ever since we were presented with the suggestion to swtich to the optional project, it seemed to have put things in line for the group in terms of a game plan. It made the concept of automating things a bit more within reach. As stated in previous posts, automation was our biggest hurdle. We restructured the tasks given out and i took on adding the public and private subnet. In addition, i also added the public and private route tables as well as the route table associations. While we have made significant progress, we still have a long way to go but it feels nice to make progress.
