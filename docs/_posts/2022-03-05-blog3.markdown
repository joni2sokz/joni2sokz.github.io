This week proved to be less successful than I would have wanted. Most of our attempts to get things working remotely have been failures. We may need to meet as a group in person where we can see eachothers work in real time and have a better understanding of what we need and what takes priority. I personally have many questions i need to clarify with the group. Will report back in next blog.
