This week felt like we really found our footing as a group. While we have been trying to stay up to date on our interactions, sometimes our shedules dont line up properly, but this time around we have been in constant communication and have been able to facilitate group meetings into successful colaborations. One of my group members and i figured out an outline for a pair of server ec2 instances. We did however run into a problem when trying to push changes to our main terraform file. only two of us had to constantly add in a "-lock=false" flag everytime we wanted to push something, otherwise we were not given permission. We are hopefull for the future of this project and hope to have major milestones met within the next few weeks.
