This week consisted of working on an output filter lab. Specifically, we used Common Gateway Interface also known as CGI. CGI is defined as the communcation protocol between the web server and a program. The web server creates a child process to run the program, with specific information provided to the process via the environment. This allows the process to read the HTTP request from stdin and the results are written to stdout. In addition to this lab assignment, i also started a new group project where he have deced to draw up the plans for a phone/tablet application that allows you to either take a picture or just point your camera at individual ingredients and get recommendations for recipes based on what you have. This project is very much in an infancy stage but over the next few weeks we will be developing it more and more. Lastly, we have started a lab assignment in my senior design class where we learn how to create dockerfiles which includes installing wget and curl. This lab then  will have us make directories as well as using tar commands to pull various binaries.

Thats all for now.
